# billiard-dynamical-system
Python code to simulate perfectly elastic collisions of 2 or more masses ("billiard balls") on a one-dimensional table, with reflection (a "bumper") at one end.

This code was written to create plots and animations for a contributed-paper presentation at the 2023 Miami University Mathematics Conference. The conference theme was "Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems and Their Applications," and my talk was entitled "A dynamical system with two (or three, or more) billiard balls." It was an extension of the system described by Dr. Gregory Galperin in his 2003 paper "Playing pool with π (the number π from a billiard point of view)"(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266523056_Playing_pool_with_p_the_number_p_from_a_billiard_point_of_view).

I am uploading the current version to GitHub in case it might prove useful to others who want to explore this dynamical system.
